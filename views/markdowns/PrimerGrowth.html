I sometimes come across ads on the internet that say “investing in xyz is like investing in Amazon in early 2000” to lure you into buying a service or articles that proclaim to tell you characteristics of great growth companies. 
Before I dig any further I think it makes sense to define what exactly a growth stock is. I like the definition from the <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/growth-stocks/">Corporate Finance Institute</a>:

*Growth stocks are stocks that offer a substantially higher growth rate as opposed to the mean growth rate prevailing in the market. It means that a growth stock grows at a faster rate than the average stock in the market and consequently, generates earnings more rapidly.*

I did a Google search for “how to find great growth stocks” and came across a number of articles that largely provided good advice. Below is a summary of some the articles I found from various, well-known finance publications: 

1. <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-find-a-growth-stock.aspx">Motley Fool</a>
    - Observing one’s own buying habits or those of people close to you to identify patterns. This idea first became popular in Peter Lynch’s famous book, One Up on Wall Street.
    - “Keeping an eye out for macro societal trends” such as health and wellness, electronic payment and online advertising.
    - Follow well-known investment funds and comb through their SEC filings for ideas


2. <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/how-to/how-to-find-growth-stocks-15177296">TheStreet</a>
    - Look at company fundamentals including the balance sheet, cash flow and income statement
    - See if the company is a “trend setter” like Starbucks created by normalizing the regular consumption of gourmet coffee. 
    - Does the company sell one product but does it really well like Facebook? Facebook has its issues but it dominates social media


3. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/010616/5-characteristics-good-growth-stocks.asp">Investopedia</a>
    - Strong leadership with innovative founders. Think of people like Bill Gates or Steve Jobs.
    - Good growth market - is the company operating in a growing market? The article cites the PC market as one that is not rapidly growing compared to a mobile-app startup. 
    - Large target market means there are more buyers for the company's products. Apple’s iPhone would not have taken off otherwise


What does the above tell you? *Finding great growth stocks is not that easy*. How many visionary leaders exist like Bill Gates that run companies in a growing market, within a large target market, have good fundamentals, are viewed as a trendsetter by consumers, are leaders in their industry and lots of consumers and dominate a specific niche?   
The above summary is a great introduction to some of the characteristics that many growth stocks share. If it was easy to select growth stocks, then companies like Amazon would never have generated such high returns due to it constantly being discounted by the market. 
One of the most respected growth investors, David Gardner, co-founder of The Motley Fool, a stock investing website that publishes free and premium content through different newsletter services,<a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/12/14/this-stock-could-be-like-buying-amazon-in-1997.aspx">first bought Amazon shortly after it went public in 1997</a>. His Stock Advisor newsletter, which came out in 2002, counts Amazon as its second best performing pick just behind Netflix. 
I bring up David Gardner because he has been kind enough to share on several occasions the various factors that lead him to choose great companies like Amazon and Netflix way before Wall Street. He lists 6 traits specifically but I want to highlight two specifically that were not mentioned in the articles I came across online:

1. **Top Dog and First Mover in an Important, Emerging Industry**
2. Sustainable Advantage Gained Through Business Momentum, Patent Protection, Visionary Leadership, or Inept Competitors
3. **Strong Past Price Appreciation**
4. Good Management and Smart Backing
5. **Strong Consumer Appeal**
6. Grossly Overvalued According to the Financial Media


In the same article above that talks about Garder’s Amazon purchase, it also talks about how Gardner bought AOL in 1994 shortly after The Motley Fool launched. It went to become a 150-bagger at its height over the next five to six years and was considered overvalued to many people.

<br/>
    
AOL’s strong past price appreciation kept people out of the stock but not Gardner. Does this mean you should blindly buy any stock that has gone up a lot and ig $ $nore valuation? Absolutely NOT. What it does mean is that a high valuation can be an indicator that the company is doing something groundbreaking and the stock price may continue to keep appreciating. Focus on the business model and what the company is doing in addition to the valuation. As one of the interviewers in The Motley Fool article states “If you're buying Ford or GM at 90 times sales, run away!”
Besides David Gardner, Catherine Wood, CEO and CIO of ARK Invest, is another great growth investor that deserves to be mentioned. Somewhat similarly but different from David Gardner who is a bottoms up investor, Wood starts with a top down approach by identifying growth sectors and investing in leaders within those industries. The graphic on the right side of the ARK Invest website highlights some of themes they invest in: autonomous technology, DNA sequencing, artificial intelligence etc.

Wood is a frequent guest on mainstream financial talk shows and offers an arguably much fresher perspective on growth investing. One of the companies that Wood talks about is Telsa - she has been a fan of the company for sometime. This is not an easy task when <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/record-share-of-analysts-have-sell-ratings-on-tesla-11581521107#:~:text=Akane%20Otani,-Biography&text=Wall%20Street%20is%20the%20most,car%20maker%2C%20according%20to%20FactSet.">there is an onslaught of bears present</a> according to the Wall Street Journal. A <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2020/10/05/how-cathie-wood-beat-wall-street-by-betting-tesla-is-worth-more-than-1-trillion/?sh=155987343d45">Barron's article</a> highlights how people such as Jim Chanos, famed short seller, and Aswath Damodaran, valuation expert at NYU, both criticized Wood’s Tesla analysis in May 2019, yet 16 months later the stock rose tenfold. Teslarati, California-based multi-platform media company that covers all things related to Elon Musk, posted an article on how Wood bought more Tesla stock after a company event in late September 2020 where the market reacted negatively because <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-cathie-wood-shows-wall-street-goes-wrong/">analysts simply did not understand</a> how Telsa, a leader in the EV (electric vehicle) market, is substantially different from automakers in the ICE (internal combustion engine) market. Lowering prices is a good thing because because achieving price parity will allow the industry to take off:

Wood further goes on to argue that analysts need to understand that Tesla is not simply an automanfactuer bu rather an energy storage, robotics, artificial intelligence and software-as-a-service company (not complicated at all):

Wood further goes on to quote an analyst on her team that to provide some raw numbers on how much growth is expected and it is staggering:

### Conclusion
How does one confidently invest in growth stocks when clearly there are so many factors at play? Obviously there is no easy answer but I do think mentioning a few companies that both David Gardner and Catherine Wood have talked positively should give investors a good start. 
Gardner mentions a number of companies on the public side of The Motley Fool where he does a podcast called Rule Breaker Investing. The stocks discussed here are often recommended in the official Ruler Breakers newsletter. Catherine Wood’s picks are all available on the Ark Invest website. Some of these stocks include:

1. Roku is a streaming powerhouse that has <a href="https://blog.pixalate.com/ott-ctv-programmatic-ad-device-market-share-roku-2019">59% market share</a> (as of 2019) in the programmatic advertising market and is currently riding the CTV (connected TV) wave. Roku’s <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3632484-roku-q3-revenues-jump-73-swings-to-operating-profit">earnings jumped 73% </a> in Q3. Streaming hours rose to by 0.2B to 14.8B. Average revenue per user increased 20% on a trailing-12-month basis to $27. In Gardner’s April 2020 podcast, <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/17/five-stocks-for-the-coronavirus.aspx">he mentioned</a> that one reason he liked the stock was due to the increase in average revenue per user as a positive. As of the article it stood at $23.14 so the trend is still heading in the right direction. ARK Invest owns Roku in its ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) and in the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE:ARKW). 
2. Sea Limited is a Singaporean gaming/e-commerce/payment company that is backed by Tencent. It operates primarily in Southeast Asia which is one of the fastest growing regions in the world and home to ~655 million people according to Wikipedia. <a href="https://www.writestock.com/articles/southeast-asias-leading-internet-company-poised-to-keep-growing">I wrote about this company</a> in a post previously. Sea’s <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3606619-sea-limiteds-q2-revenue-soars-94-on-e-commerce-rush">revenues grew 94%</a> in its most recent quarter as it’s e-commerce segment benefited due to the Covid-19 pandemic. ARK Investing owns Sea in its ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKF).  
3. Teladoc is a virtual healthcare company that has seen its business grow dramatically due to Covid-19 pandemic. It <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3627625-teladoc-health-eps-beats-0_18-beats-on-revenue">grew revenues 109%</a> in the most recent quarter. Teladoc recently merged with Livongo, a company that helps with remote patient monitoring, and grew revenues 126% in its most recent quarter before the merger with Teladoc was finalized. It is well-known that the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/072116/us-healthcare-costs-compared-other-countries.asp">U.S. healthcare system is more expensive</a> compared to the rest of the world and Teladoc <a href="https://www.healthleadersmedia.com/clinical-care/cost-savings-telemedicine-estimated-19-120-patient-visit">helps to lower those costs</a>. ARK Invest owns Teladoc in its ARK Innovation ETF, ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (NYSE:ARKG) and its ARK Next Generation Internet ETF.
