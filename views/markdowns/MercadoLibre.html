## <u> Key Points </u>
<br/>

- MercadoLibre is an e-commerce and fintech powerhouse that has delivered outstanding results for investors by focusing on an underserved area of the world-Latin America.
- Growth is still in the early stages and it seems likely that management can sustain strong revenue growth for the foreseeable future given the large TAM.
- Usual risks exist when investing in emerging markets such as political, social and economic conditions. Currencies in some of these markets are especially volatile.
- Competition has grown and Amazon has a presence in many of these markets. So far MercadoLibre has maintained its leading position but this requires watching.

MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is the “largest online commerce ecosystem in Latin America” according to MercadoLibre’s 10-K, as measured by unique visitors and page views. It is still run by the founder Marcos Galperin. Started in 1999, the company operates in 18 countries in South America. Beginning as a humble e-commerce platform, the company has expanded its ecosystem to include digital payments services. This expansive and comprehensive ecosystem has helped MercardoLibre to maintain its top dog status in the region. As Shopify, Amazon and Square have done, MercadoLibre is able to increase its share of the economics of the business by building a complete marketplace and getting closer to the transaction. It offers payments, fulfillment, advertising, webstore solutions and credit to support sellers in need of working capital. For this reason, MercadoLibre is sometimes described as a mixture of Ebay, Paypal, Amazon and Square.  
MercadoLibre breaks down its offers into six different services altogether. Below is a list of the six services and a brief description of them:

- Mercado Libre Marketplace-an online platform for buying and selling merchandise.
- Mercado Envios logistics service-provides sellers a platform to utilize logistics service providers. Enables sellers to offer an integrated shipping experience.
- Mercado Libre advertising solution-allows sellers to advertise their products through various kinds of ads on the Marketplace platform.
- Mercado Libre Classifieds service-online classifieds service for users to list goods outside the Marketplace platform. 
- Mercado Shops online webstore solution-enables sellers to create an online store on MercadoLibre
- Mercado Pago Fintech platform-an integrated online payments solution that was initially designed to help facilitate secure payments for the Marketplace platform, but is now being used by merchants all over Latin America to accept and receive payments.

Within these services, MercadoLibre groups all the revenues derived from Marketplace, Envios, advertising, Classifieds, Mercado Shops as ‘Commerce’. The Pago Fintech platform comprises revenue derived from payment fees and is classified as ‘Fintech’. These two services will be discussed in more detail below.
<br/>

##  <u> Commerce</u>
<br/>
Similar to Shopify and Amazon, MercadoLibre started by only offering one service before expanding to other areas. Amazon originally started selling books and Shopify originally started as a platform for merchants to build online store fronts. Since then, these two companies have branched out considerably and now offer a wide range of services for its customers. In the case of MercadoLibre, it started as a marketplace platform, called Mercado Libre Marketplace, for users to buy and sell goods. 
To help with fulfillment, MercadoLibre created Mercado Enviosa a logistics service similar to the Fulfilment by Amazon service offered by Amazon and Shopify Fulfillment Network offered by Shopify. MercadoLibre views Envios as an integral part of the company’s value proposition; it makes shipping more seamless and reliable and allows the company to have greater control over the user experience. Additionally, in order to encourage sellers to utilize this service, sellers become eligible to receive shipping subsidies or even free shipping for many of their sales. In May 2020, MercadoLibre set a record with 1.4 million daily deliveries utilizing Mercado Envios. 
The advertising platform allows brands and sellers to display ads on the Marketplace or suggested products when users search for goods. MercadoLibre helps brands to increase their sales with display ads through product search, banner ads or suggested products. Interestingly advertising has become one of Amazon’s fastest growing segments. In Q1 2020 Amazon’s advertising business grew 44% to almost $4 billion. Advertising is one of Amazon’s fastest growing segments. This should help MercadoLibre not only grow sales, but also help with margins since advertising is a higher margin business. 
Mercado Libre Classifieds allows users to list and sell items not typically found on the Marketplace such as real estate estate or cars. The Classifieds business likely does not generate as much revenue as the Marketplace since sellers are only charged placement fees, but according to the company it helps drive traffic to the Marketplace platform. 
Mercado Shops allows users to set up their online stores that are hosted by MercadoLibre. Users can either choose a free model or a subscription-based model if they wish to add additional services. This is quite similar to Shopify which also offers various tiered pricing options to setup stores. 
Altogether the above services comprise MercadoLibre’s total Commerce revenues. The growth has been quite impressive. Because the currencies in these emerging markets are volatile, the company highlights its FX neutral revenue growth to compare growth rates. Commerce net revenues accounted for 58.4% of total net revenues and grew 62% YoY in Q1 2020:

##  <u> E-commerce is Great, but Payments is Driving Growth</u>
<br/>
The Mercado Pago Fintech platform has grown tremendously since it was first introduced and has really helped to drive overall results for the company.
Mercado Pago is the flagship product of the Fintech segment. In order to enhance the user experience for buyers and sellers on the Marketplace platform, MercadoLibre originally developed Mercado Pago to facilitate secure payment for transactions. Mercado Pago grew quickly, and the company began to expand Mercado Pago’s services to third parties outside of the Marketplace. Digital payment infrastructure was lacking across Latin America particularly for SMEs (small medium-sized enterprises). Merchants that were not selling on the Marketplace platform were now able to process payments on their websites or using the Mercado Pago app. 
MercadoLibre went a step further and began to offer physical POS (point of sale) terminals when they realized that not only was digital infrastructure lacking for online stores, but it was also lacking for smaller merchants with physical store fronts. The company invested aggressively to offer O2O (online-to-offline) products and services for merchants. With this move, MercadoLibre went from being an ecommerce company to being a provider of end-to-end financial technology solutions for merchants all over Latin America. This is also evident when looking at growth numbers posted by MercadoLibre. In Q1 2020 the company saw its off platform TPV (total payment volume) increase 139% YoY on an FX neutral basis compared to a mere 36% increase on its platform. Off platform TPV growth has also been well over 100% the past few quarters:  
<br/>

    <img style="margin: 20px auto; display: inline; max-width: 80%; min-width: 70%;" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/0oRBD5cY8Oi6kQb5h6cV8xTjXskfV25C0U9FI0FrsJNJMw91wX_rhiWRZDbkVrQSoY2tcVF92PhHcVnsSaXqlya23f81LBPjT4jTxbPv" alt="">

</div>
<br/>
<br/>
Off platform TPV was $4.7 billion compared to $3.4 billion for on-platform in Q1 2020. Considering the larger growth rates in off-platform TPV, the gap between the two will likely only get greater overtime. Very impressive. 
In 2016 the company started offering credit services called Mercado Credito. This was launched to address the underserved consumers who lacked access to credit. At first, MercadoLibre offered credit to its merchants by focusing on their sales trends. Over time the company began to develop its own proprietary credit risk models based on how these loans performed. Leveraging machine learning and A.I., the company uses its data to score the credit quality of its customers. Importantly, because payments are done through Mercado Pago, MercadoLibre can collect principal and interest payments from merchants before distributing money they have earned from sales. 
Mercado Pago has become an important payment option for consumers outside the MercadoLibre marketplace platform. Consumers can use Mercado Pago as a wallet service. They can pay their bills with it, send peer-to-peer payments and make payments through their phones by scanning QR payment codes in stores. Users can also purchase pre-paid debit cards and withdraw balances using their Mercado Pago wallet. In 2018, the company launched an asset management product.  Users have the option to invest excess funds in a money market fund called Mercado Fondo. Most of these users likely never had an opportunity to invest in money market funds.  
It is really impressive how MercadoLibre has built up the Fintech segment and the results are translating to strong revenue growth. While Commerce net revenues grew 62% YoY in Q1 2020 on an FX neutral basis, Fintech net revenues grew 83% YoY and has outpaced Commerce revenues for the last three quarters. It now account for 41.6% of total revenues:

## <u>Competition and Similarity to other Successful Companies</u>
<br/>
Under the leadership of Marcos Galperin and management, MercadoLibre has grown at an impressive rate. MercadoLibre’s success is even more impressive when you consider how well financed their competitors are. While competition has grown in the region, MercadoLibre has managed to maintain ~56% market share in Latin America based on the number of unique visitors with Amazon ranking second around ~22% according to Statista:

<br/>
<br/>
The success of MercadoLibre can partially be attributed to its focus on serving underrepresented consumers. This story is quite similar to how Square became such a successful company in the U.S. by targeting SMEs that were overlooked by financial technology companies. StoneCo, a popular fintech company in Brazil, also followed a similar playbook by offering financial services to underrepresented parts of the population in Brazil. 
MercadoLibre’s focus on serving underrepresented parts of Latin America is arguably why the company has been able to successfully pivot to other verticals such as Fintech and create a strong ecosystem. Companies like Alibaba, Square, Shopify, Alibaba etc. became successful because they each initially started with a great product and then built other products around it to increase their moats. 
While Amazon continues to compete with MercadoLibre and others in Latin America, other foreign competitors have taken different approaches. Ebay had a partnership with MercadoLibre but the two eventually became competitors. Ebay gave MercadoLibre its Brazilian online trading platform iBazar in exchange for a 19.5% stake in MercadoLibre. Ebay later sold this stake in 2016. Contrast this to Paypal, formerly owned by Ebay, who decided to make a $750 million strategic investment in MercadoLibre in 2019 because they were…”impressed with the digital commerce and payments ecosystem Marcos (Marcos Galperin CEO) and his team have built¹.”
Summing this all up it’s no surprise that MercadoLibre is also one of the top most downloaded shopping apps worldwide and on Google Play as of January 2020:

## <u> Financials</u>
<br/>
MercadoLibre ended Q1 2020 in a strong financial position with ~$2.3 billion cash and short-term investments. The company has ~$616 million in non current loans that consists mostly of convertible notes. These 2.00% convertible senior notes were issued in August 2018 and are due in August 2028. MercadoLibre does not have the right to redeem them before August 2023. 
MercadoLibre’s profitability has varied throughout the years. It had positive net income on a GAAP basis between 2015 to 2017 but was unprofitable in the years 2018 to 2019 and in Q1 2020. As mentioned earlier, currencies in many of the countries where MercadoLibre operates are quite volatile and can negatively impact results when reported in USD. For instance, net revenues in Q1 2020 were $652.1 million, an increase of 70.5% YoY on an FX neutral basis, but “only” a 37.6% increase YoY in USD. For this reason it makes sense to focus on currency neutral results since the currency swings create too much noise. 
Net revenues in Q1 2020 were $652.1 million with a gross profit of $312.8 million. The gross margin percentage dipped to 48% compared to 50% in Q1 2019 due to extra costs associated with investments in fulfillment and warehousing. EBIT margins also decreased from 2.1% in Q1 2019 to (4.6%) in this latest quarter due to an increase in marketing spend and change in accounting methodology to account for bad debt in credit. It is important to note that MercadoLibre did not witness any change in non performing loan ratios due to Covid-19 but it nonetheless slowed down credit lending. Net loss was fairly low at $21.1 million, representing a net profit margin of ~(3%). Additionally, because of Covid-19, the company made the prudent decision to help its users by reducing listing fees for merchants, eliminating commissions on 1000 SKUs of essential products and extended a 30-day grace period to repay loans for more than 2 million customers. Management specifically noted that they are trying to maintain a balance between sustainable growth and investing. Achieving 70.5% growth in net revenues on an FX neutral basis during Covid-19 while generating a negligible loss would indicate that management is striking the right balance.

## <u> Conclusion and Valuation</u>
<br/>
MercadoLibre has achieved a lot in its 20+ year history. MercadoLibre has disrupted the retail industry in Latin America. It has managed (so far) to fend off large, international competitors such as Amazon and Alibaba. Ebay essentially called it quits when it sold its stake in MercadoLibre (although the official explanation stated it sold the stake after reviewing the strategic direction of its investment portfolio). This mistake has cost it billions; the stock closed around $173 per share and is now trading for around $980, handily outperforming Ebay’s stock performance during this time.
MercadoLibre still has multiple levers for growth. According to Statista, retail ecommerce sales in Latin America are expected to grow from ~$70 billion in 2019 to ~$116 billion in 2023². Within fintech, it would be surprising to see MercadoLibre start to launch other asset management products. Mercado Fondo, the company’s only asset management product, incentivizes its users to deposit extra money to their digital wallet by investing those funds at competitive money market rates. Additional products that incentive people to deposit funds into their digital wallet will help further strengthen MercadoLibre’s fintech lead. 
While MercadoLibre’s growth has been impressive, its size is still dwarfed by companies like Alibaba and Amazon. MercadoLibre’s current market cap is around $48 billion, while Alibaba’s is around $700 billion and Amazon is ~$1.5 trillion. Latin America is home to 644 million people so the market is clearly large enough. How does MercadoLibre become ubiquitous in the Latin America in the same way that Amazon has in the U.S.? When Amazon started, The U.S. already had reliable infrastructure. Latin America on the other hand, according to an article by The Economist, “...is hobbled by its inadequate infrastructure. More than 60% of the region's roads are unpaved, compared with 46% in emerging economies in Asia and 17% in Europe³.” The same article also states “...Latin America spends a smaller share of GDP on infrastructure than any other region except sub-Saharan Africa.” MercadoLibre is expanding its digital footprint and there is no doubt that it has helped to increase the overall value of MercadoLibre, but the company arguably risks losing its lead in ecommerce if it does not invest in offline/logistics/delivery capabilities. MercadoLibre announced in March 2020 that it was investing $420 million in Mexico⁴. Mexico is the company’s fastest growing market, and it plans to invest part of this money to build more distribution centers. While MercadoLibre is the most visited e-commerce website in Mexico, Amazon Mexico and Walmart Mexico each rank 2nd and 4th respectively⁵. 
As of 7/14 MercadoLibre trades for ~$972 per share with a market cap around $48 billion. The company achieved total net revenues of just under $2.3 billion dollars. As previously mentioned the company was not profitable in 2019. The stock has performed exceptionally well in 2020 and is up around 60% YTD. MercadoLibre did not issue formal guidance for estimated revenues in 2020. Q1 2020 results were strong and likely bode well for the rest of the year While net revenues were up 70.5% YoY on an FX neutral basis, the absolute growth rates have been trending downwards:

<br/>
<br/>

Since absolute growth rates have been trending downwards, a reasonable estimate might call for 50% growth in total revenues for 2020 on a currency neutral basis. Since it is difficult to predict currency fluctuations, it does not really make sense to estimate what 50% growth on a currency neutral basis might translate to in USD. Either way, investing in MercadoLibre requires believing that the company can continue to fend off large, well-financed foreign competitors. Paypal certainly believes that MercadoLibre is capable. The stock has rallied quite a bit this year, and while the company’s prospects are bright, it probably makes sense to wait for a better entry point or to dollar cost average into this name. <br/>
