Seeking Alpha recently published an interesting post about cloud infrastructure spend. The post indicated that total cloud infrastructure spending grew 33% YoY in Q3. Unsurprisingly, Amazon and Microsoft continue to lead the market:

Amazon, Microsoft and Google had already reported Q3 earnings before Seeking Alpha published this post, and each demonstrated impressive growth. Amazon Web Services (AWS), ranking 1st in market share, reported revenue growth of 29% YoY. Microsoft’s Azure unit, ranking 2nd, grew 48% YoY and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), coming in at a distant 3rd with 7% of total spend, grew 45% YoY. 
Including Alibaba Cloud, the 4th largest cloud infrastructure provider, these 4 companies saw combined growth of 40% in Q3:

The Seeking Alpha post quotes Canalys, a global technology market analyst firm, about how the cloud market remains resilient for consumers, governments and businesses: 

"The dependence on cloud-based tools and services remained high across all sectors of the economy, including governments, businesses and consumers, as social-distancing measures persisted. The return of stricter lockdown measures in certain regions over the coming months means cloud will remain vital for sustaining business operations, remote working and learning, as well as customer engagement."

This growth is impressive considering the uncertainty of the Covid-19 pandemic. It is clear that companies are still prioritizing IT spend. While historically one might expect IT spend to be one of the first items cut during an economic downturn, the exact opposite is happening. Spending was $9 billion higher than Q3 2019, a period during which economic growth was fairly robust growing at an annual rate of 2.1%.

    Even passive stock market followers are aware that certain technology companies are truly thriving, almost unfairly so, as many people in certain industries are hurting. Zoom grew revenue 300% last quarter, and Peloton, expected to release earnings this Thursday 11/5, might see revenue growth of 200%. Teladoc and Livongo (Livongo released Q3 earnings shortly before their merger with Teladoc was finalized) grew 109% and 126% respectively. Crowdstrike, a cloud native endpoint cybersecurity company, grew 84% in the most recent quarter ending 7/31/2020. 

While these are not cloud companies, they each utilize cloud companies to rapidly scale their business. In a blog post from 2018 Amazon writes about Peloton utilizing their AWS service: 

“...the in-home fitness company relies on AWS to power it’s on-demand, live leaderboard. Peloton’s leaderboard requires high elasticity, low latency, and real-time processing to deliver customizable rider data for the community of users riding together virtually from the comfort of their homes”

Amazon also had a blog post back in 2016 about how Crowdstrike was utilizing AWS to host its product, store data, and perform machine learning to analyze data. As a startup, Amazon quoted Crowdstrike’s senior director of engineering and chief scientist about the benefits of AWS:

 	“If you’re a startup and you’re not in the cloud, you’re already behind the competition,” says Plush (senior director of engineering) “We knew the cloud could help us spin up resources when we needed them, pivot where we had to, and not use capital expenditures to build our own data centers.” The company decided that Amazon Web Services (AWS) offered the best cloud solution for its purposes. “AWS is the gold standard for cloud computing,” says Krasser. 

	Crowdstrike later began to introduce its services for sale on AWS marketplace for customers to secure their cloud environment. Crowdstrike has continued to enhance its offerings on AWS and put out a press release in September 2020 about these features:

“Crowdstrike, a leader in cloud-delivered endpoint protection, today announced the expansion of support for Amazon Web Services (AWS) with new capabilities that deliver integrations for the compute services and cloud services categories. Through these expanded services, CrowdStrike is enhancing development, security and operations (DevSecOps) to enable faster and more secure innovation that is easier to deploy. 

In late April 2020, Oracle announced that Zoom had chosen Oracle Cloud as a Cloud Infrastructure Provider to support its growth. Zoom already was utilizing AWS and needed a second provider (they were unlikely to choose Google or Microsoft as they competitors in the video conferencing business). Oracle posted an article on their website about Zoom utilizing Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to support Zoom’s users:

“We recently experienced the most significant growth our business has ever seen, requiring massive increases in our service capacity. We explored multiple platforms, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure was instrumental in helping us quickly scale our capacity and meet the needs of our new users,” said Zoom CEO Eric S. Yuan. “We chose Oracle Cloud Infrastructure because of its industry-leading security, outstanding performance, and unmatched level of support.”

What does this all mean? Tech was doing well before the pandemic and is still doing well during it. We are in the middle of a global economic and health crisis. AWS, Azure, GCP and Alibaba Cloud together grew 40% in Q3 2020. The existence of cloud infrastructure has allowed companies like Zoom, Peloton and Crowdstrike to grow like weeds because these cloud infrastructure companies allow them to scale quickly. It is reminiscent of  when Instagram was launched right around the time that the iPhone4 came out which essentially replaced point and click cameras. Instagram would have never taken off otherwise. 

The strong performance of tech stocks has not gone unnoticed. Naturally, several articles have shown up recently on the internet about how tech stocks may underperform or how the growth is unsustainable. With the election happening today, November 3, articles have appeared for weeks on how to position one’s portfolio depending on the outcome. According to Forbes, a second Trump term would benefit sectors such as oil & gas, financials and healthcare. Energy and oil & gas have been crushed this year in part due to low energy prices and low interest rates. According to Kiplinger, a Biden victory would help clean energy stocks, and conversely might hurt the energy and oil & gas sectors due to the risk of higher regulation. 

While it is interesting to speculate how certain industries might do in the short term depending on who wins the election, “jumping in and out of the stock market based on your feelings about an election or your forecast of the stock market is a mistake” to quote well known financial blogger Barry Ritholtz. Investors do a very bad job of trying to time the market.  Do not let the news scare you out of this strong performing segment of the market. Tech/cloud stocks should still be a part of every investor's long-term portfolio. Yes, tech stocks do make up a large weighting of the S&P 500, the highest in 40 years according to Business Insider. Tech/cloud stocks will not always outperform, and I am certainly not suggesting to put all your eggs in one basket, but it is clear that the demand for cloud services has not waned. Capital Group, an investment firm based in Canada, posted a great article in November 2018 that is still relevant today. The article makes a number of interesting points about how tech stocks have done well for reasons that likely include their large cash balances, multiple business lines, above-average growth etc. This chart illustrates and drives home the point that the share price is accurately tracking the performance of these companies:

Earnings growth drives market return over the long run. The share prices of info tech stocks have largely tracked earnings since 2008, which is in stark contrast to the tech bubble in the early 2000’s. Stay long tech and cloud stocks.
