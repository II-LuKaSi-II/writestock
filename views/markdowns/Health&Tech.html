##    

The healthcare system in the United States, compared to other developed countries, scores poorly on just about any metric available. <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/quality/among-11-countries-us-ranks-last-for-health-outcomes-equity-and-quality.html">Among 11 developed countries, the U.S. ranks last for health outcomes, equity and quality.</a>

I often try to overlook this fact. However, recently I was reminded of the U.S.’s low healthcare ranking from a November 10, 2020 article that appeared in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/us-life-expectancy-low"> Our World in Data.</a>  While life expectancy continues to increase for most developed countries, the life expectancy for Americans has declined since 2014! The chart below speaks for itself:

    <img style="margin: 20px auto; display: inline; max-width: 60%; min-width: 50%;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/10/LE-vs-Health-Exp-2020-version.png" alt="">
</div>
<br/>

The article points out clearly why the U.S. has a lower life expectancy than other developed countries:

* ...Americans suffer higher death rates from smoking, obesity, homicides, opioid overdoses, suicides, road accidents, and infant deaths. In addition to this, deeper poverty and less access to healthcare mean Americans at lower incomes die at a younger age than poor people in other rich countries. * 

I became somewhat more optimistic on the state of American healthcare when on November 17th, earth's most customer-centric company, Amazon announced the launch of <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/introducing-amazon-pharmacy-prescription-medications-delivered"> Amazon Pharmacy.</a> Amazon Pharmacy will allow customers to buy prescription medications for home delivery. The top of the press release states:

* Amazon Prime members receive free two-day delivery and up to 80% savings when paying without insurance, with new prescription savings benefit. *

This information is sourced from a news post in <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3636969-amazon-makes-waves-launch-of-pharmacy-business"> Seeking Alpha.</a> As some people who follow Amazon may already know, this move was not entirely unexpected since Amazon acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/28/amazon-buys-pillpack-an-online-pharmacy-that-was-rumored-to-be-talking-to-walmart/">PillPack</a>, an online pharmacy, in June 2018. Before Amazon acquired PillPack, several large companies had approached PillPack about a possible acquisition according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/10/why-amazon-bought-pillpack-for-753-million-and-what-happens-next.html">CNBC.</a> 

The CNBC article provides some interesting facts about the prescription drug industry in the U.S.:


- Spending on prescription medications is approaching $500 billion per year.
- 60% of American adults have at least one chronic illness such as heart disease or diabetes, and 40% have two or more chronic illnesses.
- The retail drug market for prescription drugs is dominated by large pharmacy chains like CVS and Walgreens along with some independent pharmacies. They all count on pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), who work as the intermediaries between insurance companies, pharmacies and manufacturers to negotiate prices.  

The CNBC article mentions the possible strategic rationale behind the deal and reviews PillPack’s history:

- Fred Destin, an early PillPack investor, describes the space as “complicated and expensive” with the potential to win a “big prize”. Bezos likes to invest in businesses that require large amounts of dollars, have antiquated technology and have scared away the “smart money”. 
- The ecosystem of physicians, insurance companies and medical record providers are all disconnected. Amazon could help to remedy these inefficiencies. 
- Amazon can stand up to the PBMs, which effectively determine whether a pharmacy is able to get customers. The PBMs do not want Amazon to encroach on their mail-order services. 

Interestingly, it took Amazon more than two years to launch the pharmacy business after acquiring PillPack. Perhaps the business is more complicated than Amazon thought, or perhaps it just took Amazon a while to really try and address the inefficiencies in the prescription drug market.

Hopefully Amazon’s acquisition of PillPack will fare better than the partnership that <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/010616/5-characteristics-good-growth-stocks.asp">Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JP Morgan</a> created in 2018 to disrupt the healthcare industry. At that time, the news made quite a splash in the media. In 2019 the companies <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/06/amazon-jp-morgan-berkshire-hathaway-health-care-venture-named-haven.html#:~:text=%7C%20CNBC%20(c%2Dr)-,The%20joint%20health%2Dcare%20venture%20between%20Amazon%2C%20J.P.%20Morgan%20and,tackle%20rising%20health%2Dcare%20costs.">announced</a> that this mysterious partnership would be called Haven. In May 2020 a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-21/bezos-buffett-dimon-joint-venture-fails-to-disrupt-health-care">Bloomberg</a> article titled, The Amazon-Berkshire-JPMorgan Health Venture Fails to Disrupt, highlighted the failing efforts of two top executives, including the CEO’s attempt to stem the rise in healthcare costs,  As a result of their inability to implement a successful plan to disrupt the healthcare industry, both executives would leave the company.  

Due to the importance of this subject, I want to clearly point out some of the  inefficiencies in the healthcare system in the United States.  In my research, I came across another <a href="https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2020/07/how-does-the-us-healthcare-system-compare-to-other-countries">interesting article</a> that highlights how the U.S. spends about $940 per person just on administrative costs, four time more than the average of other wealthy countries:

##How is this Related to Investing?
I bring all this up because while I am not traditionally a top-down investor, it is truly mind boggling at how much change is needed in the U.S. healthcare system. As investors, we should be on the lookout for disruptive tech healthcare companies that can help to address these challenges. Listed below are several companies that address the urgency of this matter:

1. Teladoc - The 800 pound gorilla of the telehealth space. Teladoc has grown by acquisition throughout the years. This is a risky strategy, as the investor must trust that management does not overpay for assets and/or try to mask a slowdown in organic growth. The telehealth industry is fragmented and is <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-us-telehealth-market-is-expected-to-grow-at-a-cagr-of-over-29-during-the-period-20192025-301046934.html"> expected to grow</a> at a 29% CAGR between 2019-2025. <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3627201-piper-ultra-bullish-on-teladoc-see-28_5-cagr-for-20-years">An analyst at Piper</a> thinks that Teladoc can grow at 29% CAGR for 20 years! The current pandemic shows both this company’s agility and readiness to deal with such a multifaceted crisis as it has already addressed the demand for remote care. Teladoc recently completed its acquisition of Livongo for $18.5 billion. This acquisition helps provide tech-enabled solutions that monitor and manage people with chronic conditions. Prior to being acquired, Livongo had experienced tremendous growth.  It’s most recent quarter saw revenue growth of 126.4% YoY while Teladoc’s revenue growth was “only” 109.3%. The strategic rationale for the acquisition makes complete sense. Teladoc doctors can use Livongo’s data to provide comprehensive care to clients that are in over 170 countries.  This care can be delivered globally, even though Livongo itself, is primarily based in the United States. Teladoc is not yet profitable. It has a profit margin of (12.4%), but did achieve positive Adjusted EBITDA of $39.5 million on revenues of $288.8 million. Lastly, telehealth can <a href="https://www.healthleadersmedia.com/clinical-care/cost-savings-telemedicine-estimated-19-120-patient-visit">achieve big cost savings</a> by diverting patients away from unnecessary emergency room visits.

2. Amwell is another telehealth company that recently went public on September 17th 2020. <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/pr/17981895-google-cloud-and-amwell-partner-to-transform-and-expand-access-to-virtual-care">Google invested $100 million</a> into the company shortly before the company went public in August. As part of the agreement <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/pr/17981895-google-cloud-and-amwell-partner-to-transform-and-expand-access-to-virtual-care">Amwell agreed to use Google Cloud services</a>. Amwell recently had its first <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3635720-american-well-and-nbsp-eps-misses-0_54-beats-on-revenue">earnings release</a> as a public company and saw revenues up 80% YoY. Similar to Teladoc, Amwell is not yet profitable either, and is focused on growing the top line. Amwell, however, is much less profitable. Its most recent quarter showed Adjusted EBITDA of $(26.2) million, a net loss exceeding total revenues, a net profit margin of (103.3%), and a market cap of ~$5 billion. As such, Amwells’ market cap is much smaller when compared to Teladoc’s current market cap of ~$26 billion. The company does have a number of partnerships with companies such as the Cleveland Clinic, Cisco and Philips. <a href="https://business.amwell.com/press-release/apple-heart-study-demonstrates-ability-of-wearable-technology-to-detect-atrial-fibrillation/">Amwell supported a study</a> in late 2017 that was run by Stanford University and sponsored by Apple ”...to determine whether a mobile app that uses data from a heart-rate pulse sensor on the Apple Watch can identify atrial fibrillation”. Patients were advised to schedule telehealth visits with Amwell if an irregular pulse was detected. Moving forward, the market will follow with keen interest both the direction and competitive growth strategies that this company adopts.              

3. GoodRx - Similar to Amwell, GoodRx went public recently on September 23, 2020. GoodRx is a marketplace for prescription drugs. Patients that need to buy prescription drugs can search on GoodRx’s platform for the cheapest price. According to a <a href="https://www.goodrx.com/blog/ten-billion-and-counting-how-goodrx-helps-america-save-on-healthcare/">blog post</a> from the company in March 2019, the company had saved Americans $10 billion on their prescription drugs. The author of the blog post, co-founder and CEO Doug Hirsch, provided an interesting anecdote about how he once went to a local pharmacy and asked how they determine drug prices. The pharmacist replied “I honestly don’t know. I just charge whatever the computer shows.” All good economics students know that <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asymmetricinformation.asp">information asymmetry</a> is a market failure and leads to inefficiencies. Hirsch finishes the blog post by saying: “Our goal remains the same :  to help provide every American with access to affordable healthcare. We believe that we can reduce costs while improving access and quality.” The stock retreated in price, due to Amazon’s announcement of the launch of Amazon Pharmacy just a few days ago. The CEO pointed out that... "The GoodRx is a marketplace, Amazon is a pharmacy... People perceive it as going head-to-head with us, but it’s not." If GoodRx can break into other revenue streams that should also bode well for the long term. 

4. Peloton - Peloton may not be classified as a healthcare company but it sure is growing quickly. Revenue was up 232.4% YoY in the most recent quarter with monthly churn of only 0.85%. Of the $757.9 million in total revenue generated in Q3, subscription revenue was $156.5 million, accounting for ~20.6% of total revenue. The company guided for revenues of $3.9 billion or more in FY 2021, which implies subscription revenue will be around $800 million! According to an <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3628399-peloton-apple-and-lululemon-dominate-in-evercore-survey-of-young-adults-teens">Evercore survey</a>, Peloton ranks highly with Lululemon and Apple with young adults and teens. Because the company cannot keep up with demand, it is <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3635651-peloton-to-skip-black-friday-cyber-monday-deals-due-to-heavy-demand">not offering any Black Friday/Cyber Monday deals</a> this year. While Peloton is best known for its bikes, the company offers a treadmill, Tread+, and is releasing a cheaper version called Peloton Tread in early 2021. It is also investing in new content including Bike Bootcamp and Peloton Barre. As previously discussed above, obesity is one of the causes of the decline in average life expectancy for Americans. Perhaps, the most exciting news that has come about for this company, is that it has <a href="https://blog.onepeloton.com/peloton-beyonce-partnership/">announced a partnership with Beyonce</a>. Beyonce has already been the most requested artist by Peloton members.

<br/>

5. Apple - One would be remiss not to mention Apple when it comes to healthcare. I mentioned the study above that Apple sponsored with Stanford University.  Amwell was responsible for patient follow ups. Apple CEO Tim Cook <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/08/tim-cook-teases-new-apple-services-tied-to-health-care.html#:~:text=%22If%20you%20zoom%20out%20into,the%20%22Mad%20Money%22%20host.">stated in an interview</a>, in January 2018, with Jim Cramer of Mad Money fame, “I believe, if you zoom out into the future, and you look back, and you ask the question, ‘What was Apple’s greatest contribution to mankind?’ it will be about health.” Those are some strong words. It is well-known that Apple <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/20/apple-still-has-a-lot-of-room-to-grow-in-health-care.html">has hired</a> an internal team staffed with doctors, health coaches, and engineers over the years. Apple’s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/13/apple-could-win-big-in-health-care.html">three current areas of focus</a> in healthcare include: 1) hardware like the Apple Watch, 2) software, like the Health App and ResearchKit, and 3) Fitness+, Apple’s new subscription service. The Apple Watch can provide heart rate notifications, irregular rhythm notifications, and an ECG app. On the developer side Apple offers tools such as ResearchKit that enables your iOS app to become a powerful tool for medical research. Fitness+ will provide workout classes through the Fitness App and will sync with your Apple Watch. Fitness+ has not launched yet and will be offered as a standalone product. While all these developments show great promise, including a <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/09/16/apple-watch-exercise-work-out-singapore-pay-government/#:~:text=Apple%20is%20partnering%20with%20the,download%20an%20app%20called%20LumiHealth.">partnership that Apple recently inked with the Singaporean government</a> to incentivize citizens to stay healthy by earning rewards for exercising.  Apple arguably has not made any major breakthroughs in this regard as of yet. According to one person, Apple, along with Google and Amazon, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90440921/amazon-and-apple-will-be-our-doctors-in-the-future-says-tech-guru-peter-diamandis">will be our doctors by 2020</a>.
